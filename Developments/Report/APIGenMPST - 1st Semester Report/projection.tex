When \textit{global types} admit all the \textbf{projectability properties} then it can be submitted to the next phase on the MPSTs pipeline.\\
\textbf{Projection} refers to the step where \textit{local types} are derived from the \textit{global type}. Each projection is the local understanding of the \textit{global type} from the point of view of a given role.\\
\\
Implementation-wise, the projection phase begins with the collection of all roles from the \textit{global type}.\\
Then, for each agent, there will be an attempt to translate the \textit{global type} where only the actions related to the agent are aimed to be kept.\\
When the role is not present in an interaction, either as sender or as receiver, then said interaction is replaced by the internal \textit{local type} \textbf{skip}.\\
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala, caption=Projection]
private def projection(global: Protocol, role: String): Protocol =
    global match
        // terminal cases //
        case Interaction(agentA, agentB, message) =>
            if      role == agentA then Send   (agentA, agentB, message)
            else if role == agentB then Receive(agentB, agentA, message)
            else    Skip
        case RecursionCall(variable) => RecursionCall(variable)
        // recursive cases //
        case RecursionFixedPoint(variable, globalB) => RecursionFixedPoint(variable, projection(globalB, role))
        case Sequence(globalA, globalB) => Sequence(projection(globalA, role), projection(globalB, role))
        case Parallel(globalA, globalB) => Parallel(projection(globalA, role), projection(globalB, role))
        case Choice  (globalA, globalB) => Choice  (projection(globalA, role), projection(globalB, role))
        // unexpected cases //
        case _ => throw new RuntimeException("\nExpected:\tGlobalType\nFound:\t\tLocalType")
end projection
\end{lstlisting}
After such replacements are preformed, there will be a cleaning phase where as a side effect all \textbf{skips} will be propagated, until it has reached a state that can no longer be simplified, that is, only \textit{local types} that mention the role and are allowed and no \textbf{skip} is present.
