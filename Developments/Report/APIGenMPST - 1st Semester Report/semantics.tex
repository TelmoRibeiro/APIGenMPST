Semantics are currently in development.\\
At the present it is being tested an \textbf{operational semantics} where it is allowed \textit{weak sequentialisation}.\cite{Edixhoven-branching-2023}\\
That is, in \textbf{G$_1$ ; G$_2$}, it is not mandatory for \textbf{G$_1$} to be fully reduced in order for \textbf{G$_2$} to start reducing.\\
In fact, is is only necessary that there are no dependencies from \textbf{G$_1$} in \textbf{G$_2$}, allowing more expressiveness in the MPSTs.\\
The goal, on the subject of semantics, is to allow multiple ones to be implemented and tested in order to achieve a greater grasp from the MPSTs.
